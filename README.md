My name is Ooh Jing Xuan, this is all the source code for my project. However my source code will be divided into two folders: (as i couldn't get it to sync with each other)
- Spotify Web API
- my-api-project2

In the my-api-project-2, there is a folder named node_modules and there are too many files to be uploaded in GitHub so I will email u sir the folder which u have to put in my-api-project2 to run the code
